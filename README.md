# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview of Project

Pewlett Hackard is looking to evaluate the retirement rate and what positions will need to be filled. Pewlett Hackard is offering retirement packages for those that qualify and would like to monitor the rate in which employees will age out of the work force to include those eligible for the retirement packages. To continue to invest in their employees, Pewlett Hackward is evaluating a mentorship program. 

The available employee information is located in six CSV files; this project will import the available data and create exportable CSVs to show those eligible for the retirement package, retirement, and mentorship program leaders.
