# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## Overview of Project

Pewlett Hackard is looking to evaluate the retirement rate and what positions will need to be filled. Pewlett Hackard is offering retirement packages for those that qualify and would like to monitor the rate in which employees will age out of the work force to include those eligible for the retirement packages. To continue to invest in their employees, Hewlett Packward is evaluating a mentorship program. 

The available employee information is located in six CSV files; this project will import the available data and create exportable CSVs to show those eligible for the retirement package, retirement, and mentorship program leaders.

The total ride counts per city type (defined as Rural, Suburban, and Urban) show that there is an expected significant increase, 260%, in larger urban areas than in suburban or rural areas. Likewise, the number of total rides significantly decreases, -500%, further looking at the data from rural cities.

The total amount fo drivers per city type supports the data reflecting the amount of rides per city type in that there is a significant increase, 490%, in the total driver count in more populated urban cities and further decreasing, -628%, in the suburban cities and further decreasing in the rural cities.

Continuing with the trending data that urban cities have the most activity with the ride share app; the total collected fares provide supporting evidence for this conclusion. The total collected fare for the urban cities is 205% more than the rural cities. Additionally, the total collected fares in the suburban cities is 447% more than the rural cities.

The average fare per city type reflects that the ride per driver dynamic creates lower fares in the more heavily populated urban cities possibly suggesting that there are more rides that are more competitively priced as the urban average fare is 126% less than the suburban cities and the suburban cities are 112% less than the rural cities.

## Business Recommendation Summary

The analysis and visualizations offer a look into the different city types to see where there is opportunity to to identify challenges and increase business. A few recommendations are:

1. Increase advertising efforts to drive traffic to booking ride share app fares to increase the fares in urban cities.

2. Increase drivers in rural cities to supplement the demand.

3. Explore more service driven rides in urban areas by targeting customers that are utilizing ride share apps to avoid parking charges, city traffic, travel to and from business and personal appointments and errands.
